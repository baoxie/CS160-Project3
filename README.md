Overview:
Our project, Tips, is an application that utilizes mobile and wear interfaces to supplement new, or onboarding, baristas everywhere. The typical onboarding time is about two weeks, but with our application we hope to expedite that process by tackling pain points of drink making (and customizing for specialty drinks) restocking or locating supplies, and easily calling a manager or experience barista for assistance.
